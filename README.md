I made this recipe page using HTML and CSS and some help from Frontend Mentor!

I had some issues with the instructions list - took me a while and some research to figure out the counters way of replacing the numbers in an ol, and then placing them absolutely and moving the rest of the text so that the actual instructions would line up without the 2nd line of text appearing under the number.

Any and all feedback is welcome!
